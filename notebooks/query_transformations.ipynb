Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.'),\n",

The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.'),\n",

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction).

       "'The main components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system interact with each other in a coordinated manner to enable autonomous behavior. \\n\\n1. Planning: The agent utilizes techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals. CoT prompts the model to think step by step, while Tree of Thoughts explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step, creating a tree structure. This planning process helps the agent to organize its actions and make informed decisions.\\n\\n2. Subgoal Decomposition: By decomposing tasks into multiple manageable steps, the agent can enhance its performance on complex tasks. This component allows the agent to handle large tasks efficiently by breaking them down into simpler subgoals.\\n\\n3. Reflection and Refinement: Self-reflection is a crucial aspect that enables autonomous agents to learn from past actions, refine strategies, and improve iteratively. By reflecting on past mistakes and refining decision-making processes, the agent can enhance the quality of its final results.\\n\\n4. Interaction with the Environment: Through techniques like ReAct, the agent can interact with the environment using task-specific discrete actions and language prompts. This interaction allows the agent to generate reasoning traces in natural language and perform actions like using the Wikipedia search API. By combining reasoning and acting within LLM, the agent can effectively engage with its surroundings and carry out tasks autonomously.\\n\\nOverall, these components work together harmoniously to enable the LLM-powered autonomous agent system to solve complex problems, learn from experiences, and interact effectively with the environment, ultimately leading to autonomous behavior.'"
